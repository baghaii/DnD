# DND5 API Demo

This is an Android application demonstrating the use of DND5 
api (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/2014/). On the main screen, 
there are four buttons "Classes," "Features," "Monsters," and 
"Spells." Each button can be used to navigate to a new screen 
that calls the appropriate API endpoint.

The application uses a NavGraph to navigate to the different screens, and most of the 
screens use MVVM architecture.
